Instructions for Coding Exercise 04

1. Create 1 more route (called settings) and protect this route with the JWT solution
    The final result will be:
    Index >> with the login (already done - not protected)
    Dashboard (already done - protected)
    Settings (needs to be done - should be protected)
2. Add a button on the Homepage so you can access the new route "settings".
3. Use the HTML5 API History.pushstateLinks to an external site. to update the URL when you change routes.
4. In the NodeJS, change the JWT expire to 3 minutes.
5. In the front end, implement some code so that if JWT is expired, then the page will reload on the root address.
